# Youtube Like-Ratio Extension

## Background
You may have heard that YouTube is ditching the downvote button. Some users have expressed discontent at this decision, as it will make it harder to decide if a video is worth watching. Down votes can be important for many types of videos such as DIY and tutorials. A low like to dislike ratio can signal a red flag with the video's content. 

## Purpose 
The Like Ratio extension will leverage the remaining information (likes and view count) to gauge a video's popularity.
